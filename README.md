## A Hyrule Compendium Web Application

A simple web application that leverages the awesomely free [Hyrule Compendium API by Aarav Borthakur](https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com). You can select a category and entry to get details about various resources found in the Nintendo Switch masterpiece _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_.

NOTE: This is an example web application I made to get made in ReactJS to get more comfortable with the developing in the JS framework.

## Build/Develop

Follow these steps:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev` (development) || `npm run build` (compile)
